MCQs

Python Operators
What will the output be of ((500//7) % 5) ** 3?

1
Feedback:
(500//7) means integer division. Hence, you will get 71.
71 % 5 will return the remainder when 71 is divided by 5. Hence, you will get 1.
1 ** 3 will return 1 raised to the third power. Hence, you will get 1.

--------------

Indexing
How will you extract ‘love’ from the string S = “I love Python”? (More than one option may be correct.).

S[2:6]
Feedback:
The substring ‘love’ in S starts from index 2 and goes up to index 5. Hence, you need to write ‘S[2:6]’ to extract it, since the last index mentioned, i.e. 6, will be excluded by default.

S[-11:-7]
Feedback:
Alternatively, you can also use negative indexing in Python, with the last index being ‘-1’. Hence, by using a negative index, you can extract ‘love’ by writing ‘S[-11:-7]’.

----------------

Operator Precedence
What will the output of 3 * 3 ** 3 be?

81
Feedback:
Correct! In precedence order of operators, exponential comes first, hence (3**3) is evaluated first. So you get 3 * 27, i.e. 81.

------------------

Tuples
If you have a tuple T = (3, 5, 7, 11), what will the output of T.append(9) be?

Error
Feedback:
Tuples are immutable, i.e. once a tuple is created, you cannot alter it. This is why if you attempt to append a value to the tuple in the question, Python will throw an error.

-------------------

2-D List Indexing
What will the output of the following program be?
L1 = ['Vikas', 'Akshay', 'Sanskar', 'Mahima']
print(L1[1][-1])

y
Feedback:
L[1] gives the string at index ‘1’ which is ‘Akshay’ and L[1][-1] will give the last character present in the string ‘Akshay’, i.e. ‘y’.

--------------

Appending to a List
What will the output of the following code be?
l = [32, 34, 12, 27, 33]
l.append([14, 19])
print(len(l))

6
Feedback:
The append() function appends the two numbers as a list so the new list will now be [32, 34, 12, 27, 33, [14, 19]]. Hence, the new length becomes 6.

--------------------

Sets
Which of the following statements is incorrect regarding sets in Python?

Sets are immutable
Feedback:
Correct. Sets are mutable by nature, i.e. their contents can be altered.

-----------

Dictionary Iteration
What will the output be of the following code?
D = {1:['Raj', 22], 2:['Simran', 21], 3:['Rahul', 40]}
for val in D:
     print(val)

1
2
3
Feedback:
By default, iteration in a dictionary is done over the keys of the dictionary. Hence, the code will return ‘1, 2, 3’. The name of the variable used for the iteration (‘val’, in this case) is insignificant.

---------------

Python Comprehensions
What will the ‘comprehension equivalent’ be for the following snippet of code?
for sentence in paragraph:
    for word in sentence.split():
        single_word_list.append(word)


[word for sentence in paragraph for word in sentence.split()]
Feedback:
[word for sentence in paragraph for word in sentence.split()] is the right comprehension equivalent of the code provided. You need to put it in square brackets [] since the output will be a list.

---------------------------

Range Function
What will the output of the following line of code be?
print(list(range(10, 1, -1)))

[10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2]
Feedback:
Correct! In this case, you have specified that you need integers from 10 to 1 with each value incrementing by -1 or simply each value decrementing by 1. Hence, you get all the integers in descending order from 10 to 1 excluding 1.

Graded Quiz I - Cricket, Football and Hockey

All Three
Which are the students who play all the three sports?

[40, 95]
Feedback:
Correct! When you convert the given lists, (C, F, H) into sets and find their intersection, you get [40, 95].

---------------

Only Cricket and Hockey
Which are the players who play both cricket and hockey but don't play football?


[20, 21, 25, 62, 67, 71, 75, 76, 82]
Feedback:
Here you need to find the intersection of C and H. But since that will also include players who play football, you need to explicitly subtract the football players.

-------------------

Exactly Two
How many players play exactly two sports?


22
Feedback:
Here, you need to find the people who play exactly two sports. So you need to find out people who play C and F, F and H, and F and C and take their union. But since this will also include the people who play all the three sports, you need to subtract that. The final list, hence turns out to be 22 players long.

----------

None of Them
Which of these players do not play any of the sport? (More than one option may be correct)


41
Feedback:
Here you need to take a union of all the three sets C, F, and H. Now, since you know there are 100 students numbered 1 to 100, you can create a set containing numbers from 1 to 100. Finally, you subtract the union of C, F, and H from this set and get the required list of people who do not play any of the sports.


63
